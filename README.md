# UniversalWPF
A set of WPF Controls ported from Windows Universal

NOTE: This is a work in progress. State Triggers are not working yet. RelativePanel _should_ work but needs lots of testing (please help!), SplitView is partially working, but needs some work still.

## Sponsoring

If you like this library and use it a lot, consider sponsoring me. Anything helps and encourages me to keep going.

### Controls

 - RelativePanel - Fully implemented but needs more testing (please help and report any rendering differences between this and Universal's RelativePanel). Want to see this built-in in WPF?

 - SplitView (Very much work in progress - doesn't animate in/out and closed compact mode isn't rendering)

 - StateTrigger / AdaptiveTrigger (API complete, functionality not so much)
